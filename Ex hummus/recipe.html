<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
    have read over the years.
</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
</ul>
            
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li><mark><del>Remove</del> <ins>the</ins> skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</mark></li>
    <li><sub>Remove</sub> all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
</ol>
    <br>
    <p>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</p>
    <p>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</p>
    <strong>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper,
        lime and
        chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</strong>
    <br>
    <i>Storage</i>
    <br>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
    <br>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
